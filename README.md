 # Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Title: At last, a “Better” way to finance your home. 

### Overview and Origin:

Home mortgage lending company headquarter in New York, NY. Better mortgage originally started in 2014 by founders who were frustrated with the “American” home loan mortgage process, this led to new beginnings of a  revolution in the industry.

Company CEO Vishal Garg shares his personal story of the frustrating rollercoaster experience that he had to endure while seeking to purchase his first home in New York. After falling in love with the right home to accommodate his growing family, Vishal was let down by the horrible experience he had searching for a bank or lending company that could provide him a pre approval. His nightmare had only started as he later discovered that the process was even worse, the process required to provide  a laundry list of personal documents and information that took lots of his personal time. 

Vishal recalls feeling extremely let down by the system in place “I remember thinking to myself: “there must be a better way.” It only took a little research to find out there wasn’t.” This is when in 2014 he put together a team from different backgrounds and skills that would help him to set up a streamline process to help home loan applicants.  

From then until now Better has raised 254 millions from private investors. Allowing them to grow and continue to do what they do best, make home loans an easy process!


### Business Activity:

Since 2014 Better has helped multiple borrowers to achieve their goal of purchasing or refinancing their homes. Unlike typical big lenders and banks, Better has streamline the process making it less confusing, minimizing the amount of documents required and high fees associated with the loans. 

Better targets the market of future and present home owners, most specifically those who prefer an easy accessible experience. Better also has a tool that allows customers to be pre approved within 3 minutes! This tool really targets one of the main pain points experienced by Vishal, when he kept searching for a lender that could pre approve him to purchase his home, unfortunately  a typical bank or mortgage lender takes a few weeks to provide a pre approval to customers, this tool really gives better advantage in the industry.

Quick data verification tools allow Better to speed up the underwriting process. By asking clients to answer a few simple questions and in return receive a pre approval in minutes. Also implementing AI and machine learning technology to attract new lenders and streamline the lending process. 

### Landscape:

Better is part of the real estate and mortgage domain. Some of the biggest innovations in this sector  in the past 5-10 years have been using blockchain technology to review data and documents that tend to slow down the loan process, for example income verification and title information on properties.  The innovation FinTech has brought to the real estate domain has opened up  the doors for other similar companies to offer flexible, accessible home loans, documents processing and data analysis. Other competitors in the domain include, flyhomes, and rocket mortgage. 

### Results:
In 8 years, better has expanded to over 20 states nationwide and works closely with real estate agents in those states to change the industry and provide a better experience for the customer. 
Thanks to the new innovation integrated on their services, Better is able to cut down atleast 10 days on the process compared to other lenders and banks.

### Recommendations: 
 
 Though majority of customers that prefer Better as their mortgage company are first time home buyers. I believe Better Mortgage should also focus on assisting those who are already home owners and may not want refinance their loan but instead need a home equity loan or line. This will allow current home owners to have access to a flexible lending channel when needs come up. For example if a home owner needs to fix the roof on their house because of a recent damamge. Having acces to a HELOC in a few days can make a big impact on that customers financial picture and safety. I believe extending their products to lines and loans can help Better mortgage tap into a new section of customers. The customers who wish to use their assets to cover for large expenses.
